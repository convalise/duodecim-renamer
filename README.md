## Duodecim BGM Cheat Generator

This project is a freeware fanmade **CWCheat** generator developed for changing the soundtrack display titles of the [Dissida Duodecim](https://store.na.square-enix.com/product/283075/dissidia-012-duodecim-final-fantasy-psp) game.

This will change only the text cached to the internal memory of the PSP, so the original game is not altered at all and all its content remain **untouched**.

It was a great opportunity to learn more on Java programming, and it would make me really happy if my work helps people out there. =)

**Built with Java 7.**
The latest version of JRE/JDK can be found [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

**Requires CWCheat.**
All information about the installation and usage of the CWCheat plugin can be found [here](http://gamehacking.org/wiki/CWCheat).
